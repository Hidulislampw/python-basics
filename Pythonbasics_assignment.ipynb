        "\n",
        "Ans 6. Lists in Python are mutable, meaning their elements can be modified, added, or removed after creation. This is because lists store references to their elements, allowing in-place modifications without changing their memory address. On the other hand, tuples are immutable, meaning once they are created, their elements cannot be altered. This immutability makes tuples faster and more memory-efficient than lists since they do not require extra memory for modifications. Python optimizes tuples for performance and safety, making them useful in scenarios where data should remain constant, such as dictionary keys or fixed configurations. Lists, however, are preferred when the data is dynamic and needs frequent updates. The key difference lies in how Python manages memory and performance, with tuples being more efficient for read-only operations and lists being flexible for data manipulation.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans 7. In Python, the '==' operator is used to compare the values of two objects, checking if they contain the same data, while the 'is' operator checks whether two objects refer to the same memory location**. This means that even if two different objects have identical values, '==' will return 'True', but 'is will return 'False' unless both variables point to the exact same object in memory. For example, two separate lists with identical elements will be considered equal using '==', but 'is' will return 'False' because they are stored at different memory addresses. However, for immutable objects like small integers and short strings, Python optimizes memory usage by caching certain values, so variables with the same immutable value might point to the same memory location, making 'is' return 'True'. Understanding the difference is important to avoid unexpected behavior, especially when working with mutable data types like lists and dictionaries.\n"

        "\n",
        "Ans 8. Logical operators in Python are used to perform Boolean logic operations, allowing multiple conditions to be evaluated together. There are three logical operators: 'and', 'or', and 'not'. The 'and' operator returns 'True' only if 'both conditions'are 'True'; otherwise, it returns 'False'. The 'or' operator returns 'True'if at least one condition is 'True', and it returns 'False' only when both conditions are 'False'. The 'not' operator negates the Boolean value, converting 'True' to 'False' and 'False' to 'True'. These logical operators are commonly used in decision-making structures like 'if' statements and loops, enabling efficient control flow in programs. For example, in an authentication system, 'and' can be used to check if both a username and password are correct, while 'or' can allow access if at least one security condition is met. Understanding logical operators is crucial for writing complex conditional statements in Python.\n"

        "Ans 13. In Python, both 'for' and 'while' loops are used for iteration, but they differ in their approach and use cases. A 'for' loop is typically used when the number of iterations is known in advance, such as when iterating over a sequence like a list, tuple, or range. It provides a controlled way to execute a block of code a fixed number of times. On the other hand, a while' loop is used when the number of iterations is not predetermined and depends on a condition being met. The loop continues executing as long as the condition remains 'True'. This makes 'while' loops useful for cases where iteration depends on user input, external events, or dynamically changing conditions. While 'for' loops are less prone to infinite execution since they run on predefined sequences, 'while' loops require careful condition handling to avoid infinite loops. In summary, 'for' loops are best for iterating over collections or fixed ranges, while 'while' loops are ideal for condition-based repetition where the number of iterations is unknown.\n",
